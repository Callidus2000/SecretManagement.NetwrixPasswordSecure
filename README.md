<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

This Powershell Module is an extension to the [Microsoft Secret Management Module](https://github.com/PowerShell/SecretManagement) for accessing secrets stored within the Netwrix Password Secure Server. It is a wrapper for the API which is only accessible by using a C# SDK provided by NetWrix __only to enterprise customers__. __The module is useless if you are no enterprise customer__ (regarding the license modell you are using).



The usage of the SDK is documented in the [Netwrix Helpcenter](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/) filed under the keyword 'SDK'. You have to sideload/copy the SDK *.DLL files to a given location in order to get the module up to work (see [Installation](#installation)).

Since v2.0.0 it supports 
- multiple organizational units for storing new secrets
- automatic analysis of configured password forms
- storage of SecureString, PSCredential and HashTable secrets  
  (yet undocumented as if no one is using my module I spare my free time somewhere else than in documenting the most complex part)
- usage of pre-deployed configurations (e.g. by GPO) (undocumented as of the same reason)

### Built With

* [PSModuleDevelopment](https://github.com/PowershellFrameworkCollective/PSModuleDevelopment)
* [psframework](https://github.com/PowershellFrameworkCollective/psframework)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

## Prerequisites

- Powershell 7.x (Core) (If possible get the latest version)  
  Maybe it's working under 5.1, just did not test it
- A Password Secure Server with a user account

## Installation

The releases are published in the Powershell Gallery, therefor it is quite simple:
```powershell
  install-module SecretManagement.NetwrixPasswordSecure -Scope CurrentUser
```

As the module 100% depends on the C# SDK API DLL Files you have to request them from the vendor. After acquiring the zipped files please extract them into the subdirectory `SecretManagement.NetwrixPasswordSecure.Extension\bin`. The local path is hinted by an error message if you try to import the module while the DLLs are missing:

```Powershell
Import-Module SecretManagement.NetwrixPasswordSecure
WARNING: [15:47:39][<Unknown>] Required Assemblies (like PsrAPI.dll) are missing in the folder 'C:\Users\root\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\SecretManagement.NetwrixPasswordSecure\1.0.0\SecretManagement.NetwrixPasswordSecure.Extension\bin'. They are provided for *Enterprise* cutomers by the product vendor on request. Please unzip all provided *.DLL within this folder
```
## Register a Secret Vault
To interact with a password server you have to register it as a SecretVault. For this task you've got multiple possibilities, ordered from "Simple, but non customizable" to "You have to know what you are doing, but then you may configure the weirdest scenarios".

### Use an interactive assistant


## Internal Concepts
The solution is not only focused on security but also on customizability. For understanding some configuration/usage scenarios you need to know the basics.

### Password Forms
The administrator of the server can configure multiple password forms which can be used by the regular user to store secrets in a standardized manner. Each named form defines named fields of different types. E.g. a regular credential form may consist of 'username' and 'password' fields while a form for a physical server adds information about the 'root ssh key' and the password for the BIOS or ILO interface. For the secret management extension it's necessary to know which fields belong directly to the secret itself or are just additional (meta) information which do not have to be kept secret.

### Password Container
Every password entry is a container. Each password container can be derived from a password form or be built from ground up without any standard. The password container has child items which represent the named fields (see [Password Container](#password-container)).

### Organizational Units (OU)
All password containers are grouped in hierarchical groups called organizations. Each organization has a type: 'Group' (for sharing information between users) and 'User' (most times only permissions for the named user himself.)

## Combining all together                                     
If the user wants to store a secret in to this solution he has to choose to which OU the new entry should belong (if no default is configured), which form to use and then he has to fill out all the necessary fields. If a secret is queried the extensions searches for an entry with the given name, tries to identify the base form of the container and them maps the field to the queried information type (credential, secret information, ..).

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
# Usage
First you have to register the SecretManagement Vault:
```Powershell
# With the provided helper
Register-NetwrixSecureVault -Server "myserver" -UserName "max.mustermann" -Database "PWS8" -vaultName "PWS"
# Or by native command
Register-SecretVault -Name "PWS" -ModuleName SecretManagement.NetwrixPasswordSecure -VaultParameters @{
    server="myserver"
    UserName="max.mustermann"
    Database= "PWS8"
    port=11016
}
```

Lets pretend you've got just three entries stored in your server: `foo`, `hubba` and `hubba` (yes, a dupe regarding the name within different containers).
```Powershell
Get-Secret -Name foo

UserName                     Password
--------                     --------
foo      System.Security.SecureString

Get-Secret -Vault $Vaultname -Name hubba
[Error] Multiple credentials found; Search with Get-SecretInfo and require the correct one by *.MetaData.id
Get-Secret: Unable to get secret hubba from vault PWSafeInt
Get-Secret: The secret hubba was not found.
```
Seen it? The SecretManagement Framework does not allow to query duplicate entries, in the concept (off-world) there rule uniqueness regarding the name attribute. As duplicate names can be used you have to acquire the GUID of the correct entry and query this record in particular

```Powershell
Get-SecretInfo -Name hubba |fl

Name      : Hubba [5dd937c4-b0a0-ed11-a876-005056bce948]
Type      : PSCredential
VaultName : PWS
Metadata  : {[userName, Foo], [id, 5dd937c4-b0a0-ed11-a876-005056bce948], [Beschreibung, Hubba], [memo, ]…}

Name      : Hubba [ef2fe11d-b0a0-ed11-a876-005056bce948]
Type      : PSCredential
VaultName : PWS
Metadata  : {[userName, hubba], [id, ef2fe11d-b0a0-ed11-a876-005056bce948], [Beschreibung, Hubba], [memo, ]…}

# Query the one with the username 'hubba'
Get-Secret ef2fe11d-b0a0-ed11-a876-005056bce948

UserName                     Password
--------                     --------
hubba    System.Security.SecureString
```
For updating use `Set-Secret`:
```Powershell
Set-Secret -Secret (Get-Credential) -Name foo
```
Attention: If you use a `SecureString` secret only the password is updated, using a `PSCredential` secret updates the username, too.

For adding a new secret you also use Set-Secret - Sometimes in the future, as it's currently under development.
```Powershell
Set-Secret -Verbose -Vault $Vaultname -Secret $myNewSecret -Name "MUrks"
Set-Secret -Verbose -Vault $Vaultname -Secret $myNewSecret -Name "API\MUrks 2"
Set-Secret -Verbose -Vault $Vaultname -Secret $myNewSecret -Name "API\MUrks 3|Passwort"
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
# Roadmap
New features will be added if any of my scripts need it ;-)
## v1 - Released
- Get Access to stored secrets by best guess approach which data is stored where
## v2 - Under development
The vaults should be as customizable as the password storage. Therefor a system will be developed which allows the configuration of provided password forms and field associations. To keep the effort for team/company usage as low as possible it will be possible to distribute this mapping information e.g. by GPO and registry settings.

The main focus of this module is to get access to our internal Password Servers. As the system is quite easy to customize (see [Internal Concepts](#internal-concepts)) I'd bet it might not be usable for your installation. If running into problems [open a new issue](https://github.com/Callidus2000/SecretManagement.NetwrixPasswordSecure/issues), I try to look into it.

I cannot guarantee that no breaking change will occur as the development follows my internal DevOps need completely. Likewise I will not insert full documentation of all parameters as I don't have time for this copy&paste. Sorry. But major changes which classify as breaking changes will result in an increment of the major version. See [Changelog](SecretManagement.NetwrixPasswordSecure/changelog.md) for information regarding breaking changes.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Callidus2000/SecretManagement.NetwrixPasswordSecure/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

If you need a special function feel free to contribute to the project.
